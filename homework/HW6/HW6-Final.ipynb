    "## Problem 1\n",
    "This problem builds on Problem 2 of Homework 5 in which you wrote a binary search tree.  This time, you will write a class to perform traversals of the BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an iterator class called `DFSTraversal` with the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__init__(self, tree, traversalType)`: Constructor takes a `BinaryTree` object and one of the enums from `DFSTraversalTypes`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from enum import Enum\n",
    "\n",
    "class DFSTraversalTypes(Enum):\n",
    "    PREORDER = 1\n",
    "    INORDER = 2\n",
    "    POSTORDER = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `changeTraversalType(self, traversalType)`: Change the traversal type\n",
    "* `__iter__(self)`: This is the initialization of an iterator\n",
    "* `__next__(self)`: This is called in the iterator for getting the next value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reminder\n",
    "In lecture, we discussed three types of depth-first traversal: preorder, inorder, and postorder.  In addition to the lecture notes, here is another reference: [Tree Traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first_search).\n",

    "### Demo of  `DFSTraveral`\n",
    "Here's how you might use your `DFSTraversal` class:\n",

    "input_array = [3, 9, 2, 11]\n",

    "    bt.insert(val)\n",

    "3\n",
    "9\n",
    "11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Put your `BinaryTree` class (from homework 5) and your `DFSTraversal` class in a file titled `TreeTraversal.py`. Failure to follow this instruction will result in point deduction.  We provide a skeleton class below.\n",
    "\n",
    "***IMPORTANT***\n",

    "You should start from your own `BinaryTree` class (from HW5).  However, if parts of your implementation from HW5 were incorrect, you may use the methods from the solution we provided."
